# Container Image Vulnerability Scanner
## Product Requirements Document

**Date:** March 30, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for a Container Image Vulnerability Scanner that will enable users to efficiently identify, assess, and remediate vulnerabilities across thousands of container images. The system will provide intuitive visualizations and actionable insights to prioritize critical security issues while managing large-scale container deployments.

## 2. Problem Statement

Organizations using containerized applications face significant security challenges:

- Managing vulnerabilities across thousands of container images
- Prioritizing remediation efforts for critical and high-severity issues
- Identifying which specific images require immediate attention
- Understanding the security posture across the entire container ecosystem
- Efficiently allocating resources to fix the most important security issues first

## 3. User Personas

### Primary User: Security Engineer
- Responsible for maintaining security compliance
- Needs to quickly identify critical security issues
- Must report on overall security posture to management

### Secondary User: DevOps Engineer
- Needs to know which images to fix and how
- Responsible for implementing security fixes
- Requires specific, actionable information

### Tertiary User: IT Manager
- Needs high-level overview of security status
- Requires metrics to make resource allocation decisions
- Must understand trends and improvements over time

## 4. Core Requirements

### 4.1 Dashboard and Overview

- **Real-time vulnerability summary** displaying:
  - Total number of scanned images
  - Total vulnerabilities by severity level (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
  - Percentage of vulnerable images vs. clean images
  - Trend analysis showing vulnerability progression over time

- **Risk prioritization metrics**:
  - Top 10 most vulnerable images
  - Most common vulnerability types
  - Images with newly discovered vulnerabilities

### 4.2 Detailed Vulnerability Management

- **Comprehensive image inventory**:
  - Sortable and filterable list of all container images
  - Search functionality by image name, tag, or repository
  - Bulk selection options for remediation actions

- **Detailed vulnerability information**:
  - CVE identifiers with severity ratings
  - Affected components and versions
  - Vulnerability descriptions and potential impact
  - Remediation recommendations

### 4.3 Remediation Workflow

- **Action-oriented interface**:
  - One-click generation of remediation plans
  - Ability to prioritize fixes by severity, impact, or custom criteria
  - Integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated fixes

- **Verification and validation**:
  - Re-scanning capability to verify fixes
  - Before/after comparison views
  - Success metrics for remediation efforts

### 4.4 Reporting and Compliance

- **Automated reporting**:
  - Scheduled vulnerability reports
  - Compliance status against industry standards (e.g., NIST, CIS)
  - Executive summaries for management

- **Export capabilities**:
  - CSV, PDF, and JSON export options
  - API access for integration with other security tools
  - Custom report generation

## 5. Technical Requirements

### 5.1 Scanning Engine

- Support for all major container image formats
- Ability to scan images directly from container registries
- Incremental scanning to minimize resource usage
- Offline scanning capabilities for air-gapped environments

### 5.2 Performance

- Scan at least 100 images per hour on standard hardware
- Results database optimized for quick filtering and sorting
- Response time under 2 seconds for dashboard loading

### 5.3 Integration

- API-first design for seamless integration with:
  - Container registries (Docker Hub, ECR, GCR, etc.)
  - CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, etc.)
  - Security information and event management (SIEM) systems
  - Ticketing systems (Jira, ServiceNow)

### 5.4 Data Management

- Secure storage of vulnerability data
- Historical data retention for trend analysis
- Data export/import capabilities

## 6. User Interface Requirements

See accompanying wireframes for visual representation of the following screens:

1. Dashboard/Overview
2. Vulnerability List View
3. Image Detail View
4. Remediation Planner
5. Reports and Analytics

## 7. Success Metrics

- 100% of critical vulnerabilities identified accurately
- 90% reduction in time to identify vulnerable images
- 75% reduction in time to remediate critical vulnerabilities
- 99% system availability

## 8. Constraints and Considerations

- Must support enterprise-scale deployments (10,000+ images)
- Compliance with data privacy regulations
- Support for air-gapped/offline environments
- Minimal impact on existing CI/CD pipelines
